### Reflections
in complete sentences or paragraphs, and perhaps images or videos. reflections on what you learned and how you learned it an assessment of the state of your work

I learned more about how to maninpulate Grasshopper and add shapes and parameters to make adjustments. I followed the tutorials online and in class to follow along, and changed the file to experiment with which changes affects the file. I had trouble understanding how to set up the file, and would need to restart sometimes to get the result I wanted. 

### Speculations
in complete sentences or paragraphs, and perhaps images or videos. speculation on future direction for the tools [so much is changing very quickly right now, where do you think this is going? Why do you think this?] speculation on future direction for the work

Learning more about these tools, I think that this process can be more beginner friendly so that it is viewable from one tool rather than needing to switch between grasshopper, rhino, and online tools. I also think 3D modeling can be changed so that instead of modeling a object from scratch, being able to easily input a physical object, whether through scanning or pictures, this can be done at a faster pace and converted into a simplified 3D mesh.
