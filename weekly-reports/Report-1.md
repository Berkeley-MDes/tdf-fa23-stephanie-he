### Reflections
in complete sentences or paragraphs, and perhaps images or videos.
reflections on what you learned and how you learned it
an assessment of the state of your work
I learned how to use Rhino and Grasshopper in order to change the parameters. I had trouble opening the file and navigating Rhino, but I got some help from classmates, and then laser cut the model. 
I wasn't confident in my ability to learn the software and laser cut, so I started early to make sure I had time to ask for help if I had trouble. This worked well, and I want to have a similar approach in the future

### Speculations
in complete sentences or paragraphs, and perhaps images or videos.
speculation on future direction for the tools [so much is changing very quickly right now, where do you think this is going? Why do you think this?]
speculation on future direction for the work
I believe Rhino and Grasshopper are great tools to help have parameters in CAD right now, but in the future it could be even more helpful to allow functionality to translate existing models more easily into grasshopper. For instance, being able to read an existing item in the real world and being able to change its parameters in grasshopper would help customize many items and streamline the process of building out an object "programmed" with grasshopper.
