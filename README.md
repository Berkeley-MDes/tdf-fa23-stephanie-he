# Stephanie He, Technology Design Foundations
Welcome to my GitHub repository ^^


I'm in my masters at Berkeley, where I’m studying the design of emergent technologies such as AI, ML, and mixed reality. From physical microcontrollers to 3D modeling, I’m having a blast learning new tools and systems!
In my work, I’m excited to create tools for users with data-informed and detail-oriented design. In teams, I enjoy having a balance of autonomy and collaboration to be able to grow not only my own skills, but also together as a team.

# Weekly Report 4 - Week of 08/21/2023 #

## Getting feedback from classmates - Reflection ##
On Thursday I was able to get feedback from classmates. While I was happy with the end product, I felt that my explanation in the video was not sufficient and needed more detail into the process and decisions made. To address this, I added more detail into each step in my final pdf paper detailing my progress and steps. This not only showed my process better, but also better encapsulated what my model in Rhino and Grasshopper was capable of.

## Setting up Proton2
In addition, I am setting up my microcontroller set and started setting up Proton2 to prepare for the workshop today. I had some trouble with connecting to Wifi and flashing to the device, but I asked for help to problem solve the situation.

## Speculations ##
When it comes to our everyday experiences, something as simple as a headphone stand can turn into a personalized work of art, like the ribbed model in this stand. Personal items can be adjusted to exact products and other objects you own. 

With AI, smart assistants can help create designs that match your personal preferences and your workspace aesthetic. AI assistants can analyze user data and preferences to create designs specific to an aesthetic or niche. In addition, this makes getting a design or aesthetic you want to lean towards a reference point for the AI to use and incorporate. 

These tools used with AI will impact engineering as well, as the optimization for complex models with precision can be much more accurate. This potentially reduces error significantly and makes product designs ready much more quickly. Using Grasshopper, engineers can establish relationships in designs more easily with parameters. However with AI, this can be further explored by being able to use human language and thought processes to create models without needing to do the complex calculations and implications. 

But it's not just about the outer aesthetic; it's about being smart and flexible to the user needs as well. Laser-cut designs can help make the material usage far more efficient. They minimize waste and make the most of materials, making this project not just customized to one’s taste but more eco-friendly.
