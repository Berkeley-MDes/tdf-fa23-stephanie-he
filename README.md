# Stephanie He, Technology Design Foundations
Welcome to my GitHub repository ^^


I'm in my masters at Berkeley, where I’m studying the design of emergent technologies such as AI, ML, and mixed reality. From physical microcontrollers to 3D modeling, I’m having a blast learning new tools and systems!
In my work, I’m excited to create tools for users with data-informed and detail-oriented design. In teams, I enjoy having a balance of autonomy and collaboration to be able to grow not only my own skills, but also together as a team.

### :star: Whatever you write in your **README.md** will show up on the “front page” of your GitHub repo. This is where we’ll be looking for your [weekly progress reports](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/desinv-202/wiki/3.0-Weekly-Submissions). They might look something like this: ###
